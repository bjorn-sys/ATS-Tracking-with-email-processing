Option 1: The "Problem-Solution" Post
Headline: Tired of drowning in resumes? Let AI do the first round of screening. ü§ñ

Post Text:

Is your hiring process slowed down by a mountain of unqualified applications? We've all been there. Sorting through resumes is time-consuming, repetitive, and frankly, not the best use of a recruiter's or hiring manager's valuable time.

That's why I built the ATS Resume Scorer ‚Äì a smart, automated tool that streamlines your hiring pipeline right from the inbox.

Here‚Äôs how it works:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Fetching: It connects directly to your dedicated hiring email and pulls in all new applications and their resumes.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Scoring: Each resume is instantly analyzed and scored based on keyword matching, structure, experience, and best practices (just like a real ATS!).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Intelligent Sorting: Resumes that score above your set threshold (e.g., 80%) are automatically moved to a "For Screening" folder. The rest are filtered out.

Why you'll love it:
‚úÖ Save 10+ Hours/Week: Automate the tedious first pass and focus on human connections.
‚úÖ Never Miss a Top Candidate: Data-driven scoring reduces unconscious bias and highlights the best matches.
‚úÖ Seamless Workflow: It works with your existing email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) ‚Äì no new software to learn.

This is built for startups, busy HR teams, and hiring managers who want to hire smarter, not harder.

Option 2: The "Demo" Post (Short & Punchy)
Headline: Your new recruiting assistant is here, and it works while you sleep. üò¥

Post Text:

Imagine this: Your job ad goes live. Applications pour into your email. But instead of you having to open each one, an AI instantly:
‚Ä¢ Reads each resume
‚Ä¢ Scores it against your job description
‚Ä¢ & Moves only the qualified candidates (80%+) to your "To-Review" folder.

That's it. Your morning is now free to actually talk to great candidates instead of hunting for them.

I built a tool that does exactly that. It's an ATS Resume Scorer with Email Automation.

I'd love for you to check out the demo video here: [Link to your Video/Demo]

This is for every recruiter and founder who believes time is their most valuable asset.

Option 3: The "Builder's Post" (More Technical/Personal)
Headline: I automated the first step of my hiring process. Here's what I built.

Post Text:

As a developer who sometimes wears the hiring manager hat, I found the initial resume screening process to be a major bottleneck. I knew there had to be a better way.

So, I challenged myself to build a tool that could:

Securely connect to an IMAP/SMTP email server.

Parse incoming emails and extract resume attachments (PDF, DOCX).

Use NLP techniques to analyze and score resumes based on keyword matching, structure, and content.

Automatically sort applications into folders based on a custom quality threshold.

The result? A Streamlit-powered ATS Resume Scorer that acts as a smart filter for your inbox. It's not just a scorer; it's an automated pipeline that ensures only the most qualified resumes ever hit your desk.

It was a fascinating project that combined email automation, text processing, and heuristic scoring models.

The code is a testament to how you can build powerful, practical tools with Python.

If you're technical and curious, I've shared some insights on the architecture in the comments below üëá
